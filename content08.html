		            <p><br><strong>Visualization in the Humanities</strong> serves as a supporting platform for a humanities data visualization workshop held by Georgia Tech. It aims at presenting necessary information to not only workshop participants but also the public who care about this workshop. The later version of this website after the workshop will include a new section with projects finished in the workshop. </p>
                <br>
                <img src="img/portfolio8/001.png" width="100%"><br><br>
                <h2>Discover & Research</h2>
                <p>I start with a talk to my project advisor who is also in charge of the workshop. She encourages me to have a look at similar web designs. One thing that I find interesting is that designers would like to put all pieces of information regarding the event in one page and enable scrolling in it.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I also notice that this kind of website usually has an About and a Vision/Story section which come along with other sections containing event information. It reminds me of sharing thoughts and understandings about digital humanities as well as potentials in it in order to raise social awareness among the public. Fortunately, we do have responses from our participants which could be used in this section. </p>

                <h2>Structure & Interaction</h2>
                <p>As I talk to my advisor, she provides me a list of information and a folder of related files. I build web contents based on the information from it. I decide to have seven sections of information on the website which are About, Participants, Agenda, Logistics, Datasets, Visualization and Relationships.</p>
                <p>In terms of interaction, since I have already decided to have all the information in one page, it seems to be necessary to have a floating back to top button floating on the right bottom corner of the screen. Meanwhile, on the top of the page, each section title in the nav bar should be targeting at and able to jump to the corresponding sections.</p>
                <p>In Participants section specifically, since I have over 60 participants to display in one section, It would be horrible if I just put them out there next to each other. What I do is just showing their headshots on a grid. Only when the user clicks on particular headshot, the corresponding bio and title will popup.</p>
                <p>I consider the color scheme I should use for this website. I finally focus on three colors - red for titles, orange for links and dark blue for the rest. I also split up the page title word by word and apply the same color scheme for each word, which is also the branding logo that I am considering. </p>
                
                <h2>The Final Design</h2>
                <p>This is actually the first version of Visualization in the Humanities, since we are still waiting for our participants to submit their own bio and information. In this case, I use placehold paragraphs in it. However, the basic functionalities work well with it.</p>
