		        <div class="two-column">
		            <p><br>The idea of this mobile app originates from the frequently complaints of my introvert friends who hate eating on their own. Sometimes they just go to a restaurant alone without even knowing what they are going to order. They might see others talking about a topic which interests them and want to join, however, they usually feel ashamed to walk up and say “Hey, I am Josh, can I join in your talk?” <strong>Eating Together</strong>, at this point, help them with overcoming their sense of shame, introducing them into a group of strangers while dining in a restaurant, or even leading a group talk while eating. Through <strong>Eating Together</strong>, I would like to improve their dining experience through being able to talk with other people who share the same interests with them. </p>
                <h2>Online Survey and User Interview</h2>
                <p>To start with, I designed an online survey and collected data from 127 participants by convenience sampling. I then conducted interviews by convenience sampling with 7 introvert people who want to improve their dining experience as opposed to eating alone. During the interview, I focused on understanding the difficulties they encounter when they are trying to decide “How to eat?” My goal in research is to find out as many thoughts/concerns they considered as requirements/goals when making decisions as possible.</p>

                <h2>Users' Requirements</h2>
                <p>We find some interesting users goals from feedbacks.</p>
                <p>[1]  They want partners or a bunch of people eating with them. <br>[2]  They think it would be the best if they are able to know who they are going to talk to or what they are going to talk about. <br>[3]  They need a middle ground for them to invite or be refused by someone. <br>[4]  Sometimes it is hard for them to find partners when it is not the time for lunch.</p>

                <h2>Who is going to use Eating Together?</h2>
                <p>We came up with two major personas according to the users' requirements. </p>            
                <br>

                <h2>How do people use Eating Together?</h2>
                <p>I created a storyboard to show how the charactor uses Eating Together to choose his eating partner and restaurant. </p><br>
                <img src="img/single/4.jpg" width="100%"><br>

                <h2>How do we solve the problem?</h2>
                <p>We brainstormed for the possible solutions to meet the user needs. We decided to adopt some key features from Yelp at first (e.g. restaurants reviews, ratings, location-based recommendations) so that enables users to look through what their options are. After that, we merged a topic group function into the app where users could look for particular group fitting their needs. (e.g. dining time, topic, participants, etc.) The topic group function is, when the user picks a restaurant where he decides to eat lunch, it comes to the groups page in this restaurant, where the user could either choose to join in an existing group or create a new group and wait for people joining in, based on his/her interests or availability.</p>

                <h2>What's the structure of Eating Together?</h2>
                <p>I draw the task flow of Eating Together to figure out the struction of it.</p>               
                <br>

                <h2>Hign Fidelity UI Mockups</h2>
                <p>I created seven UI for Eating Together including a) group list b) filter c) creating new page d) profile and etc.</p>
